1 slime layer slick like ice
multiple layers act like normal slime block

Add a carved melon texture for the slime golem
change the 8th layer of the slime layer render to be a custom slimeblock texture without the middle bit
figure out how to add a "9th" layer to the slime block that adds the middle bit and converts it to a slime block
